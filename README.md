# ReadME_Maker

A command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email

Following the [common templates for user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Common_templates), we can frame this challenge as follows:

```
AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project
```

Refer to the [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md).

## Business Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

* The generated README includes a bio image from the user's GitHub profile.

* The generated README includes the user's email.

* The generated README includes the following sections: 
  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.
